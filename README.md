# Taxtharich (Vue)
A tax calculator based on The Times’ list of the 300 richest people in the UK.

In 2024, I wanted to strengthen my Vue 3 skills — especially around working with APIs. I also have a strong interest in politics, so I thought it would be fun to build an app that illustrates, in a simple way, how a wealth tax could contribute to funding public services.
